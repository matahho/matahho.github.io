## 💡 Why It Matters to Me
My time at Enigma profoundly shaped the way I think about **software architecture** and **system design**.  
Working under [**Hamid**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamid-soltani-03a923135/?originalSubdomain=ir), a highly skilled software architect, taught me the real value of **clean architecture**, **design patterns**, and **principled engineering**.  
I truly owe a lot to that mentorship — it transformed me from a student of code into a **thoughtful engineer** who values structure, clarity, and long-term scalability in software systems.
