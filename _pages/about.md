# 👋 About Me

I’m **Mahdi**, a Computer Engineering student at the **University of Tehran**.  

Currently, I’m a **Research Assistant** at the [Ordered Systems Lab, University of Michigan](https://orderlab.io/team.html), advised by [**Prof. Peng Huang**](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/). 

At [**OrderLab**](https://orderlab.io/), I work on **test-guided program synthesis** and **runtime validation** in **distributed systems** — building automated checkers that detect *silent semantic violations* in large-scale, fault-tolerant systems such as **ZooKeeper**, **HBase**, and **Kafka**. 
This work aims to improve the reliability and self-verifiability of modern distributed infrastructures.

These days, I’m also working on my **bachelor’s thesis** under the supervision of [**Prof. Kargahi**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oH19bK4AAAAJ&hl=en), investigating **batch-invariance** and [**nondeterminism in LLM inference**](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/) to eliminate nondeterministic outcomes in real-time embedded cyber-physical systems (CPS).

# 🔬 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **distributed systems**, **AI systems**, and **operating systems**.  
I’m particularly interested in:

- **Federated Learning** — exploring the intersection of distributed systems and artificial intelligence  
- **Design & Analysis of Deep Neural Networks** — including CNNs, LSTMs, and GANs, and mitigating the risk of adversarial attacks on these systems  
- Moving toward a **deterministic solution for LLM inference** in safety-critical systems   
- **Distributed Systems Reliability & Testing** — designing **runtime validators** and **test-guided program synthesizers** to detect *silent semantic violations* in large-scale systems such as ZooKeeper, Kafka, and HBase, and building tools for reliable distributed computation

# 🎯 Hobbies

When I’m not coding or wrestling with research papers, I enjoy:

- 🏐 **Volleyball** — I’m a professional volleyball player and used to compete in the national league when I was younger 😄  
- 👨🏻‍🍳 **Cooking** — especially Persian dishes (there’s nothing quite like homemade tahchin!) 🍛 
- 🧗‍♂️ **Family** — a bit of a cliché, I know, but my parents are truly remarkable people ❤️  
- 🎵 **Friends** — my gorgeous girlfriend Ghazal, Amirali, and Setareh are my favorite partners in adventure. (You’re absolutely right if you think my girlfriend made me write this. 🤪🆘)
