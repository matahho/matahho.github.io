# 👋 About Me

I’m **Mahdi**, a Computer Engineering student at the **University of Tehran**.  

Currently, I’m a **Research Assistant** at the [Ordered Systems Lab, University of Michigan](https://orderlab.io/team.html), advised by [**Prof. Peng Huang**](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/).  

These days, I’m also working on my **bachelor’s thesis** under the supervision of **Prof. Kargahi**, investigating **batch-invariance** and **nondeterminism in LLM inference** to eliminate nondeterministic outcomes in real-time embedded cyber-physical systems (CPS).

# 🔬 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **distributed systems**, **AI systems**, and **operating systems**.  
I’m particularly interested in:

- **Federated Learning** — exploring the intersection of distributed systems and artificial intelligence  
- **Design & Analysis of Deep Neural Networks** — including CNNs, LSTMs, and GANs, and mitigating the risk of adversarial attacks on these systems  
- Moving toward a **deterministic solution for LLM inference** in safety-critical systems  
- **Reinforcement Learning** for **autonomous and safety-critical environments**  
- **Test-guided program synthesis** for system correctness and checker generation, and **semantic violation detection** in large-scale distributed systems

# 🎯 Hobbies

When I’m not coding or wrestling with research papers, I enjoy:

- 🏐 **Volleyball** — I’m a professional volleyball player and used to compete in the national league when I was younger 😄  
- 👨🏻‍🍳 **Cooking** — especially Persian dishes (there’s nothing quite like homemade tahchin!)  
- 🧗‍♂️ **Family** — a bit of a cliché, I know, but my parents are truly remarkable people ❤️  
- 🎵 **Friends** — my gorgeous girlfriend Ghazal, Amirali, and Setareh are my favorite partners in adventure. (You’re absolutely right if you think my girlfriend made me write this. 🤪🆘)
