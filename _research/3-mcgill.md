I worked as a **Research Intern** at **McGill University**, supervised by [**Dr. Majid Babaei**](https://www.mcgill.ca/continuingstudies/majid-babaei), where I contributed to building **intelligent diagnostic frameworks** for distributed systems.

## 🔬 Research Focus

My project focused on enhancing a **Knowledge Graph–based framework** for **performance anomaly detection** in complex distributed environments.  
The work integrated **system tracing data (LTTng)** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enable large language models to reason about performance bottlenecks and suggest root-cause explanations.

### 🎯 Key Contributions

- Designed and implemented a **Knowledge Graph expansion module** linking trace data to semantic concepts used by the LLM reasoning layer.  
- Integrated **RAG pipelines** for contextualized anomaly analysis and automated performance report generation.  
- Improved interpretability and reduced false positives in anomaly detection through graph-structured context retrieval.

## 🧭 Vision

This research lies at the intersection of **systems observability**, **AI reasoning**, and **performance analysis**.  
By combining **graph-based representations** with **language models**, the goal is to move toward **self-explaining distributed systems** capable of diagnosing and adapting to performance issues autonomously.
