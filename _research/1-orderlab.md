I am currently a **Research Assistant** at the [Ordered Systems Lab (OrderLab)](https://orderlab.io/) at the **University of Michigan**, advised by [**Prof. Peng Huang**](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/).  
The lab focuses on advancing the reliability and correctness of large-scale **distributed systems** through **automated testing**, **program synthesis**, and **runtime validation**.

At OrderLab, our mission is to design systems that are not only efficient and scalable but also *self-verifying*â€”capable of detecting, diagnosing, and even recovering from their own errors.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

My current research revolves around **test-guided program synthesis** and **semantic validation** in distributed systems.  
In particular, I work on **Chess**, a framework that automatically synthesizes runtime checkers to detect *silent semantic violations* in production-scale distributed environments such as **ZooKeeper**, **HBase**, and **Kafka**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Contributions

- Developed a **runtime validator** that detects subtle semantic inconsistencies missed by traditional test oracles.  
- Designed automated workflows for **test-guided synthesis**, generating runtime checkers that adapt to evolving system behavior.  
- Contributed to system-level evaluation and benchmarking across multiple distributed platforms.  
- Collaborated on experimental analysis and reproducibility efforts for large-scale system testing.

This project led to the paper:

> **Chess: Test-Guided Program Synthesis for Distributed System Checkers**  
> *Wanning He, Mahdi Haji, Peng Huang, Rui Dong*  
> Submitted to the **23rd USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI â€™26)**.

## ðŸ§© About OrderLab

The [Ordered Systems Lab](https://orderlab.io/) explores how **distributed systems**, **software engineering**, and **AI techniques** can be combined to create *verifiable*, *efficient*, and *resilient* computing infrastructures.  
Research topics at the lab include:

- **Failure testing** and **bug reproduction** in cloud systems  
- **Program synthesis** for correctness enforcement  
- **Runtime validation** and **consistency checking**  
- **Performance and anomaly diagnosis** in distributed environments

## ðŸ§­ Vision

At OrderLab, I contribute to the broader vision of **trustworthy distributed computing**â€”systems that reason about their own correctness and maintain consistency even under complex real-world conditions.  
This collaboration continues to shape my passion for **automated reasoning**, **AI-driven testing**, and the **next generation of self-aware distributed systems**.
